GRAIN GUARDIANS is a desktop-based crop marketplace application built using Python (Tkinter) for the GUI and MySQL for backend data storage. This project provides a simple, intuitive digital platform where farmers can directly list and sell their crops, and consumers can browse, add items to cart, and purchase them — all in one integrated system.
